Richard A. Eisenberg's Dissertation
===================================

This repo stores all the files for my dissertation. I have decided to put
this work-in-progress in the public domain both to generate interest and
to get feedback. Thus, feedback is assuredly welcome, and feel free to post
Issues.

To build, just use `make`.

In order to build, you will need several dependencies:

1. ghc
2. lhs2TeX cabal package
3. latex & latex mk

If you're on a Mac, ghc and latex-mk can be installed via Homebrew.
lhs2Tex can be installed via `cabal install lhs2Tex`.
